# Execution Queue

Last updated: 2026-04-24

This is the compact status board for humans and AI workers.  
The authoritative control plane is still `ai_first/AI_OPERATING_PROMPT.md`.

## Latest merged result

- Latest merged PR: `#93 [MVP] T035 Offline Mode for Downloaded Packs`
- `#93` added a browser-local imported-pack fallback plus offline quiz-result sync queue, then passed all required CI checks before merge.
- Core MVP path in `main` now includes marketplace import, preview, ratings, sorting, cached marketplace browsing, mobile-first marketplace layout, metadata-driven marketplace search, batch import, offline-ready imported-pack fallback, offline quiz-result sync queue, assessment insights, adaptive difficulty selection, teacher analytics, assessment timing metrics, tutor follow-up prompts, knowledge-pack version metadata, student learning-path sequencing, PDF export, tutoring session replay, recommendation flow, KB context badges, student progress dashboard, Vietnamese prompts, route error boundaries, API rate limiting, and teacher collaboration metadata in addition to the earlier Knowledge Pack, assessment, tutor, dashboard, and contest evidence flows.

## Active queue

- No strict-order registry task is currently active.
- The last completed task was `T035 Offline Mode for Downloaded Packs`.
- Next lane should be derived from smoke gaps, evidence freshness, or the MVP goal.

## Next recommended task

Run smoke/evidence freshness checks or derive the next short task from the MVP goal, then open a new task packet and focused branch before implementation.

## Status Update (2026-04-24)

**Queue Advance**:
1. `#93` merged to `main` after all required CI checks passed
2. Issue `#92` auto-closed with the merge
3. The strict-order registry queue is now empty
4. Next work should be chosen from smoke gaps, evidence freshness, or newly created MVP tasks

## AI-owned blockers

- None currently. The scripted-reset smoke lane passed with demo-safe reset output, backend startup through the CLI server path, frontend production build, Knowledge Pack metadata, assessment session evidence, tutor session evidence, and dashboard activity.

## Human-review blockers

- None currently. Human review is still required for product direction changes, deployment or credential decisions, and any PR explicitly marked blocked.

## Read path

1. `ai_first/AI_OPERATING_PROMPT.md`
2. `ai_first/EXECUTION_QUEUE.md`
3. Task packet for the active branch
4. `ai_first/CURRENT_STATE.md` only if more context is needed
